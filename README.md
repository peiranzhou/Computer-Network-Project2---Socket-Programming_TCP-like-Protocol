# Computer-Network-Project2---Socket-Programming_TCP-like-Protocol

(a) A brief description of TCP-like protocol

I implemented a TCP-like protocol using Java. The sender and receiver main files called “sender.java” and “receiver.java”.

Files included in submitted folder - “pz2210_java”:
sender.java  receiver.java  README.txt  makefile  sender_logfile.txt  recerver_logfile.txt
original_file.txt  reconstruct_file.txt


(b) The TCP segment structure I used

b.1> The header file (20 Bytes) of TCP includes: Source Port, Destination Port, Sequence Number, Acknowledgement Number, Flags, Checksum.

b.2> The data segment of TCP is 576 Bytes.

              —————————————————————————————————————————————————————
              |Source port# (2 Bytes) | Destination port# (2 Bytes)|
              —————————————————————————————————————————————————————
              |             Sequence Number (4 Byte)               |
              —————————————————————————————————————————————————————
              |           Acknowledgment Number (4 Byte)           |
              —————————————————————————————————————————————————————
              |             Flags (4 Byte) - FIN(1 bit)            |
              —————————————————————————————————————————————————————
              |     Checksum(2 Bytes)    |    Unused (2 Bytes)     |
              —————————————————————————————————————————————————————
              |                 Data Segment (576 Bytes)           |
              —————————————————————————————————————————————————————


(c) Instruction of running the program

*************** Test on Localhost ***************

I strongly suggest to test the program on localhost firstly, making sure: 

1. the program can compile successfully, 
2. sender & receiver can be invoked in given format, 
3. statistics on sender can be printed properly, 
4. “Log File” relevant function are correct.

Running code direction:

1. cd to “pz2210_java” directory.

2. Run the make file:
2.1> $ make clean
2.2> $ make

3. Run the receiver & receiver by using following command:

3.1 IPV4 Localhost:

$ java receiver reconstruct_file.txt 8000 127.0.0.1 5000 recerver_logfile.txt

$ java sender original_file.txt 127.0.0.1 8000 5000 sender_logfile.txt 1

3.2 IPV6 Localhost:

$ java receiver reconstruct_file.txt 8000 ::1 5000 recerver_logfile.txt

$ java sender original_file.txt ::1 8000 5000 sender_logfile.txt 1


* For the domain name, you can just change the “127.0.0.1” to “localhost”.


*************** Test with Newudpl Proxy ***************

1. cd to the Newudpl Proxy directory, starting the proxy.

2. Then, cd to “pz2210_java” directory.

3. Run the make file:
3.1> $ make clean
3.2> $ make

4. Run the receiver by using following command:

$ java receiver reconstruct_file.txt 8000 160.39.138.66 41193 recerver_logfile.txt

5. Run the sender by using following command:

$ java sender original_file.txt 160.39.138.66 41192 5000 sender_logfile.txt 1


(d) For the recovery relevant function:

My TCP-like protocol can recover from in-network packet loss, packet corruption, packet duplication, packet reordering and dynamic network delay.


(e) Unusual about implementation

My protocol is pretty generic, there is no strange or unusual bug in my program. 

* But for the log file, during one packet communication (send packet - receive ACK), to make the log records more accurate, I set both sender and receiver have two log records. 
For sender: Packet Sent Log & ACK Receive Log. 
For receiver: Packet Receive Log & ACK Sent Log

* Also, for the log record’s source and destination, I recorded both the IP and port number, so that user could be easier to check out the log.

* For the last ACK, I set it to a different value, so that the sender could know whether or not the ACK is the last one. Pretty tricky.
